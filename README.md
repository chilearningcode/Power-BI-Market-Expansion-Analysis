## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 

- **Business Performance and Market Expansion:** The sales manager believes business performance is very good, sees potential for market development, and emphasizes the need for more data-driven insights for market expansion strategies.
- **Opportunities and Challenges:** The manager recognizes growth opportunities but is uncertain if the trend reflects the entire market or specific products. They aim to use data to analyze overall performance and avoid bias in evaluations.

### üë§ Who is this project for?  

‚û°Ô∏è **The Sales Manager** can make data-driven decisions on expansion strategies.

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  

- How can we leverage data-driven insights to enhance business performance and support market expansion?
- What are the specific growth opportunities, and do these trends accurately reflect the overall market or particular products?
- How can we ensure that our performance analysis remains unbiased and comprehensive while pursuing market development strategies?

### üéØProject Outcome:  

- **Overall Business Performance**: The business shows strong growth with a Month-on-Month (MoM) growth rate of 4%. The average profit margin is 12%, and the successful order rate is approximately 95%.
- **Regional Insights**: APAC is the largest revenue contributor, while Canada has the smallest revenue share but the highest profit margins at 26.6%.
- **Customer Segments**: The Consumer group leads in revenue contribution, followed by the Corporate and Home Office groups. Profit margins across these segments are consistent, ranging from 11.8% to 12.6%.
- **Product Categories**: The Technologies category generates the most revenue, followed by Furniture and Office Suppliers. However, Table products within the Furniture group show negative profits and high return rates, indicating potential quality issues.

## II. Insights and Recommendations

- The business demonstrates robust growth, with a Month-on-Month (MoM) **growth rate of about 4%**. The **average profit margin stands at 12%**, and the **successful order rate is approximately 95%**. <br> 
- APAC is currently the largest contributor to revenue, while Canada is the smallest. However, **the profit margins from the Canadian market** are significantly higher compared to other markets **(26.6%)**. <br> 
- Among customer segments, the Consumer group leads in revenue contribution, followed by the Cooperate and Home Office groups. Profit margins across these segments are fairly consistent, ranging from 11.8% to 12.6%. <br> 
- Products in the Technologies category lead in revenue generation, followed by Furniture and Office Suppliers, all contributing relatively evenly. However, Table products within the Furniture group show negative profits and a high return rate, suggesting potential quality issues.

| Market | Insights | Recommendations 
|-|-|- 
| APAC | The APAC market leads in revenue contribution with a solid **profit margin of 12%**. The return rate stands at 5.5%, which is not excessively high. The top-selling products in this market include Chairs, Bookcases, Copiers, and Phones. | Ensuring consistent high-quality customer service is key. <br> Provide responsive support and resolve issues quickly to build trust and satisfaction. <br> Special promotions and discounts during holidays can attract and retain customers. <br> Build strong relationships through regular communication and feedback collection. Implement loyalty programs to reward repeat customers and encourage loyalty. Invest in marketing efforts to maintain brand recognition and visibility.
| EU | The market ranks 2nd in revenue contribution with a **solid profit margin of 12%**. However, it also has the highest **return rate at 6.2%** and a **low order success rate of under 94%**. Products like Appliances, Accessories, Copiers, and Fasteners have notably high return rates. The most frequently returned items are Copiers, Bookcases, Phones, Storage, and Appliances. | Implement strict quality control measures to ensure products meet the expected standards before they are shipped to customers. <br> Regularly gather and analyze feedback to identify common reasons for returns. <br> Provide detailed and accurate product descriptions, including specifications, dimensions, features, and high-quality images.
| US | The market ranks 3rd in revenue contribution, with a relatively **good profit margin of 12%**. However, it has a **return rate of 6%**, primarily in the Machines product category, which has a very low total order volume. Phones and Chairs are the top revenue contributors, significantly outpacing other product categories. Besides Tables, Bookcases and Supplies also have **negative profit margins**. | Regularly gather and analyze customer feedback to identify common reasons for returns and address them promptly. Provide excellent pre- and post-purchase customer support to address any issues promptly. <br> Ensure that all products, particularly those with high return rates, meet stringent quality standards to minimize defects and dissatisfaction. <br> Regularly review and optimize operational costs, including sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics, to improve profit margins without compromising quality.

Top revenue and profit-contributing product categories include Bookcases, Chairs, Phones, and Copiers. However, **Tables have a negative profit margin and a high return rate of 10%**. | Focus on promoting and expanding the product categories that contribute the most to revenue and profit. Offer bundled deals on popular products to encourage higher sales volumes. <br> Invest in targeted digital marketing campaigns to reach a broader audience. <br> Train sales teams to upsell and cross-sell complementary products, increasing the average order value.
| AFRICA | The market ranks 5th, just above Canada, with a **modest profit margin of 10%**. The order **success rate is at 100%**, indicating a slow consumption rate for products.

Introduce time-limited promotions and discounts to encourage customers to upgrade their essential products more frequently
| CANADA | Canadian market contributes the least to revenue but **boasts an exceptionally high profit margin of 26%** and a **100% order success rate**, indicating high customer satisfaction. This market tends to favor essential products such as Storage, Accessories, Phones, Appliances, Bookcases, and Copiers. | Launch tailored marketing campaigns to increase brand awareness and attract new customers. Implement referral programs where existing customers can refer friends and family in exchange for discounts or rewards. <br> Partner with other brands or local influencers to co-promote products and reach new customer segments. <br> Conduct regular market research to identify new opportunities and understand the evolving needs and preferences of your target audience.
